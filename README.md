# 📊 LEARN-EDA

Welcome to my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** learning repository!  
This repo contains my **daily practice notebooks** where I explore, analyze, and visualize data using Python libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**.

## 🚀 Why EDA?

EDA is the **first and most important step** in the Data Science and Machine Learning workflow.  
It helps to:
- Understand the data structure
- Find patterns, relationships, and trends
- Detect missing values and outliers
- Clean and prepare data for modeling
