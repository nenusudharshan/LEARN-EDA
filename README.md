# 📊 LEARN-EDA

Welcome to my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Learning Repository**!  
This repository contains my **daily practice notebooks** where I explored, analyzed, and visualized datasets using popular Python libraries like **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**.

## 🚀 What is EDA?

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical and visualization techniques.  
EDA helps to:
- Understand the structure of data
- Detect missing values and outliers
- Discover patterns and relationships
- Prepare data for Machine Learning models
